title: SSH-MITM - ssh audits made simple
summary: man in the middle SSH Server for security audits and malware analysis # 79 char long summary
description: |
  Password and publickey authentication are supported and SSH-MITM is able to detect,
  if a user is able to login with publickey authentication on the remote server.
  This allows SSH-MITM to accept the same key as the destination server.

  If publickey authentication is not possible, the authentication will fall back to
  password-authentication.

  When publickey authentication is possible, a forwarded agent is needed to login
  to the remote server. In cases, when no agent was forwarded, SSH-MITM can rediredt
  the session to a honeypot.
